# Better Image Popups - [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orrielel/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/BetterImagePopups/BetterImagePopups.plugin.js)

### Quick Rundown:

#### What?
This is a BetterDiscord plugin that show full sized images in image popup -- Literally a reworked [Full Size Lightbox](https://gist.github.com/Jiiks/7eb81b8950c073a09fbc2493da3ec714), but also compatible with [ImageToClipboard](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ImageToClipboard), which the original breaks.

It also adds an on click event for images larger than the visible screen, that allows you see them in their pure native size.

#### How?
Open the [latest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orrielel/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/BetterImagePopups/BetterImagePopups.plugin.js) version and save the file in the BetterDiscord plugins folder (Right-click, save page as. Right-clicking the link also works). You can reach the folder either with the shortcut in the plugin list overview, or by pasting this into the explorer navigation line `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\plugins`. Make sure the filename is `BetterImagePopups.plugin.js`.

Obviously requires [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/jiiks/betterdiscordapp) installed.
