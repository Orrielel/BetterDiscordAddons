# Custom Media Support - [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orrielel/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/CustomMediaSupport/CustomMediaSupport.plugin.js)
### `„Now i can truly shitpost”`

### Quick Rundown:

#### What?
This is a BetterDiscord plugin that wraps all possible media in embeds for in-client play possibilities. This also includes previews for 4chan threads, Sadpanda galleries, Vocaroo recordings and Pastebins. There's also greentexting and magnet hotlinking.
4chan and Sadpanda previews that is stored, can be accessed through the Archive Manager, where you can filter and delete whatever you want.

#### How?
Open the [latest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orrielel/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/CustomMediaSupport/CustomMediaSupport.plugin.js) version and save the file in the BetterDiscord plugins folder (Right-click, save page as. Right-clicking the link also works). You can reach the folder either with the shortcut in the plugin list overview, or by pasting this into the explorer navigation line `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\plugins`. Make sure the filename is `CustomMediaSupport.plugin.js`.

Obviously requires [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/jiiks/betterdiscordapp) installed.

#### And?
Content fetched from Sadpanda and 4chan archives, will be cached for faster loading times and less API spam. This content can be managed through the Archive Manager, or wiped through the script settings.
Script will also notify if there's an update available.
