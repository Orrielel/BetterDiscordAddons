# Twitch Stream Panel - [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orrielel/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/TwitchStreamPanel/TwitchStreamPanel.plugin.js)

### Quick Rundown

#### What?
BetterDiscord plugin that adds a customizable panel where you can add your favorite streamers. It will either update on user action or by intervals, and will tell you when streams come online, how many are watching and what game (By hovering over). Uses member colors from [Better Role Colors](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/BetterRoleColors) if it's installed and active. You can now also import/export the lists

#### How?
Open the [latest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orrielel/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/TwitchStreamPanel/TwitchStreamPanel.plugin.js) version and save the file in the BetterDiscord plugins folder (Right-click, save page as. Right-clicking the link also works). You can reach the folder either with the shortcut in the plugin list overview, or by pasting this into the explorer navigation line `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\plugins`. Make sure the filename is `TwitchStreamPanel.plugin.js`.

Obviously requires [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/jiiks/betterdiscordapp) installed.
